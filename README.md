Search directly from the Solution Explorer to find nuget packages used across a solution:

Properties of the selected NuGet package are also displayed in the properties window:

And update/uninstall can be performed right from the node in the Solution Explorer window:

You can install this extension from the [Visual Studio gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e8d1fcad-5fa5-4353-ba9c-90f4b6a68154). 

Alternatively, you can [get the source code](http://github.com/danielkzu/NuGetReferences) and build it yourself. You will need the Visual Studio SDK.
